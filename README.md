ionic-twitter-test
==================

A Twitter client powered by Ionic Framework that I presented at the RokkinCat Hack & Tell. This is how incredibly easy it is to setup a project using Ionic Framework.

###Development Environment
If you've never developed with Node or Ionic, you'll have to follow these steps:
* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Install [bower](http://bower.io/)
* Install [ionic command line tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic)
* Follow instructions in Cordova's [Android Platform Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/android/index.html)
  * Stop at "Create New Project"
* Follow instructions in Cordova's [iOS Platform Guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/ios/index.html)
  * Stop at "Create New Project"
* Install [ios-sim](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ios-sim)

###Accessing Twitter's API
To access Twitter's API you must create an application at [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/)

###How I created this project
* Follow Simon Reimler's instructions in his article [here](http://devdactic.com/twitter-rest-api-angularjs/)

Note: In this project, I've removed my Consumer Secret from app.js
Note: ngTwitter can't authenticate with a web browser on your local machine. You must run the application in an emulator or deploy it to a device.
